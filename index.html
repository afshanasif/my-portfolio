        <p>I am Afshan asif a Passionate Developer.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p> I am currently working in a government organization, and prior to entering the field of web development, 
         I held an administrative position. I have completed my Masterâ€™s in Political Science from the University of Sindh 
         and earned my Bachelor's degree from Karachi University. After completing my studies, I realized that I wanted to 
         explore a different career path, one that aligned more with my interest in technology.
         This led me to select the field of web development, and I am committed to pursuing it with passion. I am continuous
         ly learning and improving my skills, and I aim to further advance in this dynamic field.
